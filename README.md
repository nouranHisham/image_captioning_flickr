# image_captioning_flickr

In this project, we worked on both, the flickr_8k and flickr_30k, datasets but we had some storage and runtime complications with the flickr_30k dataset.

We used the encoder-decoder model to create our image caption generator, with the encoder as a CNN network and the decoder as an LSTM network.

Datasets can be found here:

More details can be found in the report and/or presentation.
